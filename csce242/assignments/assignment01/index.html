            <p> This is my 2006 Toyota 4runner. This car is currently my daily car and was the very first car I have owned. This car has been in my family for about 18 years and was given to me after I had gotten my drivers licenses. The 4Runner is one of my favorite cars as well because of the reliability and how long it has lasted.</p>
